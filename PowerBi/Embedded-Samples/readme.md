NodeJS sample app to embed PowerBi report using clientId & clientSecret. This app can generate the EmbedUrl & EmbedToken needed for the React App.

React sample app to embed PowerBi report using EmbedUrl & EmbedToken.

These are code samples built from other guides but in a single place for easy reference. 

They are meant to be used to demonstrate how the authentication methods works and not to be used in production.

Slight changes made so that you can run the react app without getting embed object from a http response. (original code remains so you can see how that would have worked)
